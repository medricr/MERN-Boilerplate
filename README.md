# MERN-Boilerplate

This application is meant to serve as a jumping off point for a MERN application. In its current state, the app includes user verifiaction via Passport.js's local method, which can be used to create user objects which are then stored in a MongoDB documents collection. In addition to this, the application includes basic CRUD functions. The user will hav the option to create, read, update, and delete notes, objects which possess and id, a title, and a content body. While this may seem specific, to code has been written such that the note object and its associated CRUD funcitons could easily be changed to reflect a more complex document, or used as a basis for more complex operations.
